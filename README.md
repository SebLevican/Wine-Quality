# Wine Quality Analysis

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) applied to the **Wine Quality** dataset, aiming to identify patterns, correlations, and key features to predict wine quality.

## 📂 Project Contents

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Overview of the dataset.
   - Visualization of key variables and their relationships.
   - Identification of correlations between features and wine quality.

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
   - Handling missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.

3. **Feature Selection**:
   - Identifying the most relevant features for predicting wine quality.

4. **Machine Learning Models**:
   - Implementation of algorithms to predict wine quality.
   - Comparison of model performance.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Wine Quality dataset**, which contains information on physicochemical properties and quality ratings of red and white wines. You can find the dataset [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality).

### Features:
- **Input variables**: Physicochemical properties such as acidity, sugar levels, pH, etc.
- **Output variable**: Wine quality (rated on a scale from 0 to 10).
